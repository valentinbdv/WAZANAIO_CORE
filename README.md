# WAZANAIO_CORE
Share the way I use BABYLONJS library for game WAZANA.IO

## mesh.ts
Basically I like my code to be verbal, mesh.ts add a class layer with verbal functions which will get or update BABYLON object properties.

## gui.ts
Simplification of my interactions with BABYLON GUI

## Note
Other classes will come... ;)
